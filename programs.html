            <h2 id="git" style="margin-top: 0px;">Girls in Tech (GIT) Conference</h2>
            <p>The CSSociety was proud to host its first ever Girls in Tech Conference (GIT) in March 2016. GIT is an annual 1-day conference dedicated to exposing local high school girls to the many facets of tech. These curious young women come from diverse
              backgrounds, and for many, GIT will be their first look into coding, engineering, and entrepreneurship. GIT is proud to be a non-profit event with a non-discriminatory acceptance policy that requires no prior experience or academic thresholds
              to attend.
            </p>
            <h2 id="hh">HackHolyoke</h2>
            <p>HackHolyoke is an inclusive, 200-person hackathon that strives to unite young innovators from a variety of backgrounds. We believe that HackHolyoke is a 24-hour slice of what the world should look like as our generation uses technology to
              improve society and the economy: a diverse collection of motivated, curious, creative individuals, who are excited to collaborate on solutions to the problems found in various fields. We have achieved this goal at previous iterations of
              HackHolyoke, where ~53% of attendees have identified as women, and well over half have been first-time hackers. Seasoned coders are also encouraged at HackHolyoke and have been well-represented in the past. HackHolyoke is now an annual event
              held in the fall.
            </p>
            <h2 id="megasgigas">Megas & Gigas Mentorship Circles</h2>
            <p>The CSSociety introduced the <a href="#mentorship">Megas/Gigas Mentorship</a> in the fall of 2014 and has since revised its structure. Since Spring 2016, CS students are placed into small groups containing several Gigas (upperclass CS students
              — usually majors) and several Megas (students who are earlier in their CS journey, and who may be curious about starting to prioritize CS in their educations). The role of the upperclass students is to foster a supportive culture that facilitates
              open dialogues amongst the students, with topics ranging from purely curricular to the more personal. These groups, known as Megas & Gigas Mentorship Circles, gather together a few times per semester in the spirit of <a href="http://leanincircles.org/">Lean In Circles</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="profdev">Professional Development Workshops</h2>
            <p>In collaboration with departments on campus, the CSSociety hosts periodic technical interview and résumé workshops to help computing students succeed in applying for internships, REUs, full-time industry jobs, and graduate school.</p>
            <p>If you are a recruiter and are interested in meeting our students, please <a href="./contact.html">contact us</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="confhacks">Conferences & Hacks</h2>
            <p>The CSSociety also helps coordinate student transportation, lodging, and registration for various technical conferences and hackathons throughout the year. We attend events as the <a href="http://ghc.anitaborg.org/">Grace
              Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing</a>, the <a href="http://tapiaconference.org/">ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity
              in Computing</a>, the <a href="http://neucs.org/">New England Undergraduate Computing
              Symposium</a>, and Women Engineers Code (<a href="http://www.wecodeharvard.com/">WECode</a>) at Harvard. We also attend and succeed at such hackathons as <a href="http://hackthenorth.com/">Hack the North</a>,
              <a href="http://2015f.pennapps.com/">PennApps</a>, <a href="http://www.yhack.org/">YHack</a>, and <a href="http://hackumass.com/">HackUMass</a>. We work diligently to help support the financial costs of conference and hackathon attendance,
              which are invaluable experiences for our students.

              <h2 id="mentorship">Mentorship</h2>
              <img src="../assets/images/mentorship-float.jpg" class="floating-right">
              <p>In May 2014, the CSSociety won a grant from the
                <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/programs-campaigns/ncwit-awards/ncwit-student-seed-fund">
                National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) Student Seed Fund
              </a> to help support our original mentorship program, Megas/Gigas.
              </p>
              <p>As students at a small women's liberal arts college, we understand the systemic challenges that impede progress towards gender parity in STEM fields. We believe we have a responsibility to build an environment that is supportive of and is
                concentrated with powerful, capable, and confident women engineers.
              </p>
              <p>In Fall 2014, the CSSociety inaugurated a mentorship program called <i>Megas/Gigas</i>, which paired senior and junior computer science students with students in Mount Holyoke's introductory major course, CS101, and with first-year students
                in CS201. The program officially launched at a mentorship gala for CS faculty and involved students, where distinguished speakers gave remarks on the importance of mentorship and community for underrepresented groups in general, and especially
                in computing fields. Throughout the semester, the program fostered the mentoring relationships through planned and informal bonding socials like dinners, field trips, and in-house mini-hackathons, called
                <i>HackNights</i>, which provided a structured way for Gigas to share their personal experiences and advice with their Megas, and aid the latter in building the skills they would need to apply for technical internships and research opportunities.
              </p>
              <h2 id="alumnaepanel">Alumnae Panel</h2>
              <p>As the mentorship program builds community on campus, the CSSociety also hopes to foster community off-campus. In the 2014-2015 school year, the CSSociety hosted and invited a diverse panel of Mount Holyoke alumnae now working in technology
                to speak, either virtually or physically, about their experiences working in such fields as software and hardware engineering, finance, consulting, and research. This event was particularly designed to help students explore the wide applications
                of a computer science degree and to enrich the connections between alumnae and students.
              </p>
              <h2 id="makerjam">MakerJam</h2>
              <p>MakerJam was an annual embedded systems hackathon, the precursor to <a href="#hh">HackHolyoke (Fall)</a>, where students could create prototypes of their own invention and ingenuity. The hackathon welcomed students from the
                <a href="https://www.fivecolleges.edu/">Five Colleges</a> as well as students from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sisters_(colleges)">Seven Sisters</a>.
              </p>
              <h2 id="middleschool">Middle School Outreach</h2>
              <p>In Fall 2014, the CSSociety piloted a middle school outreach program, where CSSociety members visited local middle schools and introduced them to the fun of engineering and mathematics through electronics workshops. By bringing approachable
                projects to students in the critical period when many decide whether or not to pursue a future in math and science, we hope to change the prevalent pre-conceived notions of engineers and scientists, and, especially, draw more young women
                into the field.
